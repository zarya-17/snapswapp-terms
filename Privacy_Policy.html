<h1 style="text-align: center">Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Effective Date: March 1, 2025</p>
<p>At SnapSwapp, your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app</p>

<h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Emails: We collect your email address to help with account management and communication.</li>
    <li>Location of Photos: We gather location data embedded in your photos to display the location for each uploaded photo.</li>
    <li>Photos: When you upload a photo to the app, it may be processed through a third-party API (using a Large Language Model or LLM) to check for explicit content (e.g., pornographic material).</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We use your email address for account-related communication.</li>
    <li>We use the location data from your photos to show the country of origin for each uploaded image.</li>
    <li>Photos are sent via an API to check for explicit content, such as pornography. This is done to ensure the safety and appropriateness of shared content. The photos are not stored permanently; they are processed and analyzed for the purpose of content moderation only.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Data Retention</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We retain your email address for as long as your account is active or as needed for legal purposes.</li>
    <li>Location data from photos is stored only temporarily for display purposes and is not used for any other purpose or shared with third parties.</li>
    <li>Photos sent for moderation are processed through the API and are not stored on our servers once processed. Only the moderation result is retained temporarily for validation purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Data Sharing</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We do not share your personal information, including email or photo location data, with third parties, except as required by law.</li>
    <li>Photos may be sent to a third-party API for moderation, but the content of the photos is not shared beyond the necessary moderation process. The API processes the photo to detect explicit content and returns a result indicating whether it is safe to share.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Security</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure.</li>
    <li>Photos sent for moderation are transmitted securely to the API and are processed in accordance with strict privacy standards.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Your Rights</h3>
<ul>
    <li>You can update or delete your account information at any time.</li>
    <li>You can contact us at [Insert contact email] to inquire about or request deletion of your data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in the app, and the effective date will be updated accordingly.</li>
</ul>
